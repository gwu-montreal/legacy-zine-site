This means that\n<strong>by learning to recognize them and warning our fellow workers about them, we\ncan be ready and prepared when they inevitably get pulled out</strong> and render them\nineffective. Here&#39;s a few classics:</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-captive-audience-meeting\">The &quot;Captive Audience&quot; Meeting</h4>\n<p>If management ever catches wind that there&#39;s organizing (or even just vague\nunion talk) happening at the workplace, their first response will usually be to\ncall a &quot;captive audience&quot; meeting. All employees will be required to attend, and\nthe meeting will be a one-way affair where management goes over standard\nunion-busting talking points in <strong>an effort to sow fear, suspicion, and\ndistrust</strong>. The goal is to reach any workers who are uneducated about unions\nbefore their organizing co-workers do, and feed them negative preconceptions on\nthe topic. You&#39;re likely to see many of the other union-busting moves in this\nlist being deployed at those meetings, and the best way to counter them is for\nyou and your co-workers to be prepared and to know what to expect!</p>\n<p>Note also that when it comes to the topic of unionizing, managers will often\nrepeat these talking points on any platform they have access to, such as game\nindustry conferences or industry-oriented websites…</p>\n<div class=\"md-img\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/eb-text.png\"\n  alt=\"Houser Bros held a Captive Audience Meeting! Audre fell asleep!\"\n/>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"the-open-door-policy\">The &quot;Open Door&quot; Policy</h4>\n<p>Bosses often encourage workers to talk to them directly about workplace issues,\ninsisting their &quot;door is always open&quot; and that no one will be reprimanded for\nsharing concerns. A well-worn tactic everywhere from the game industry to\ncompanies like Wal-Mart or\n<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/amazons-aggressive-anti-union-tactics-revealed-in-leake-1829305201\">Amazon</a>,\nthis &quot;open door policy&quot; sounds harmless on the surface.</p>\n<p>In fact, <strong>this is the number one way management maintains full control over\ninformation flow in the workplace</strong> and ensure they are able to nip any seed of\norganizing in the bud. They&#39;ll say they are here to help and are genuinely\nconcerned about your well-being. But the catch is that <strong>it&#39;s a way to ensure\nworkers only ever interact with management alone</strong> as isolated and disempowered\nindividuals, instead of turning to their coworkers for support and solidarity.\nBosses will make vague promises and excuses, reassuring you that your issues are\ntaken seriously and will be addressed eventually, while also instructing you to\nkeep things quiet and only ever discuss the issue in question directly with\nmanagement. If they do catch you sharing concerns with other workers, it\nprobably won&#39;t take long for that supportive demeanor to disappear, which is why\n<strong>it&#39;s important to make sure any initial organizing you do happens away from\nthe eyes and ears of management</strong>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"unions-might-be-great-for-other-companies-industries-but-it-s-different-here-\">&quot;Unions might be great for other companies/industries, but it&#39;s different here!&quot;</h4>\n<p> Whether it&#39;s because games are &quot;too creative a medium,&quot; &quot;too recent an\n industry,&quot; &quot;too dependent on flexibility&quot; (boss-speak for worker precarity) or\n because the company is &quot;too indie,&quot; or &quot;too large,&quot; not making enough money or\n &quot;making too much&quot; — you&#39;ll hear all sorts of reasons why your job is very\n special, unique, and different when it comes to unionizing. The funny thing, of\n course, is that every boss in every industry says the exact same thing to their\n workers! (WORKERTIP: It&#39;s never true.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"framing-the-union-as-a-third-party\">Framing the union as a &quot;third party&quot;</h4>\n<p>Many bosses try and frame unions as some kind of external third party that will\ncome in between you and your employer, ruining your happy family relationship,\nor maybe trying to get rich off your back. (Projection much?) You might even\nhear that they are dangerous radicals seeking to overthrow capitalism! (Oh no!)\nBut in reality the union is not &quot;they&quot; — it&#39;s you. <strong>It&#39;s you and your\nco-workers who form this potential union and decide every action it takes</strong>, not\nsome outside strangers — and what your bosses fundamentally fear is <strong>the\nempowerment that you will gain through organizing</strong>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"you-can-t-have-a-union-because-you-re-not-really-employees-\">&quot;You can&#39;t have a union, because you&#39;re not really employees!&quot;</h4>\n<p>More and more employers try to paper over the true nature of the relationship\nthey have with their workers by referring to them as &quot;partners&quot; or &quot;associates&quot;\ninstead of employees, for example, or by pretending that we&#39;re all just one big\ngroup of friends; <strong>it&#39;s just that some friends own the company, and others\ndon&#39;t!</strong> Another common tactic is to give &quot;manager&quot; titles to just about\neveryone in the company, but with none of the decision-making power or\nadditional pay that usually accompanies such a role.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, <strong>many workers in the game industry who should be\nrecognized as full employees are instead hired as freelance contractors as a way\nfor owners to get around the legal obligations they owe to employees</strong>. This is\nan especially common problem in sectors like QA. However, there is a growing\nnumber of unions that specialize in helping such workers fight for better\nconditions or gain full employee status. Recently, artists and lecturers\n(primarily women) at Britain&#39;s National Gallery <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/national-gallery-workers-rights-gig-economy-public-sector-employment-tribunal-art-educators-a8803641.html\">won a\ncase</a>\nwhich confirmed that, because they were required to attend training sessions and\nwere paid from the same source as noncontractual employees, they were not in\nfact self-employed. This meant they were entitled to the same benefits as\nso-called &quot;permanent&quot; employees. <strong>Remember: if you&#39;re hired to work for someone\nwho makes a profit from selling what you produce, you can unionize</strong>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"threats-of-outsourcing-and-cuts\">Threats of outsourcing and cuts</h4>\n<p>A common line — and one frequently internalized by workers — is that if workers\nunionize, bosses will make cuts to jobs or outsource them to where labour is\ncheaper and less organized. Whether management is assuring you that they&#39;re\nreally sorry but they have no choice and it&#39;s &quot;just the way it is&quot; or they&#39;re\nopenly threatening direct retaliation for unionizing, <strong>the important thing to\nkeep in mind is that the goal of these threats is to create fear and compliance\nthrough intimidation. They usually have no basis in anything concrete</strong>.</p>\n<p>Bosses lay off workers all the time for no good reason, and unionizing is the\nonly way you have to protect yourself from that. Remember that it&#39;s always our\nlabour that creates value for the business owners, and that they can&#39;t get rid\nof all of us or they&#39;d be getting rid of the very source of all their profits.\nBesides, <strong>relocating is an extremely expensive endeavour for any business to\nmake, and not something that can be decided on a whim simply to punish workers\nfor unionizing</strong>. This is especially true if the union movement is one that\ncrosses borders in such a way that there&#39;s nowhere for the owners to go —\nemphasizing why it&#39;s so important for our organizing efforts to be international\nin nature and in solidarity with fellow workers all around the world!</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-guilt-trip\">The &quot;Guilt Trip&quot;</h4>\n<div class=\"md-img right off-1\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/baby_bowser.png\"\n  alt=\"Baby Bowser\"\n/>\n</div>\n\n<p>Some owners, especially those who think of themselves as &quot;good bosses&quot; and\nmaintain a lot of contact with their employees, might react to unionizing\nefforts by taking it extremely personally. <strong>Those bosses will try to make you\nfeel like you are committing some sort of horrible betrayal by contemplating the\npossibility of organizing</strong>, and try to shame you for being ungrateful or make\nyou feel like you somehow owe them for &quot;giving&quot; you a job.</p>\n<p>Remember that the core issue is the inequality of power between you and them,\nand that they are reacting that way because they are so used to holding that\npower over you and acting without any accountability to employees, that <strong>any\nstep towards a more equal relationship feels to them like some kind of terrible\noffence</strong>. Some bosses have been known to respond to union organizing efforts\nwith tears! These sentiments may even be genuine, but in any case, dealing with\nthem should be the responsibility of your boss&#39;s therapist, not their employees.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-company-union\">The &quot;Company Union&quot;</h4>\n<p>Some bosses claim to support unions, and will even offer to help you set one up.\nIf your boss tries to pull this move, you might think at first you&#39;re very lucky\nto work for such a progressive employer. They might even bring in people to do\nit for you and take care of all the complicated stuff… until you realize that\nyour new &quot;union&quot; was created without any organizing among the workers\nthemselves, that it includes company management in its decision-making, that it\nreproduces the same power dynamics that were always present in your workplace,\nand that it was implemented in a top-down fashion to ensure its loyalty to the\nowners over the workers. This sort of cooptation can really succeed at\nappropriating and neutralizing pro-union sentiment, dramatically setting back\nany genuine organizing efforts — <strong>don&#39;t let it happen to you!</strong></p>\n<p>A similar role is played in our broader industry by some currently-existing\nindustry organizations, who publicly claim to represent game developers but <strong>in\npractice are led and funded exclusively by business owners and management</strong> and\nhave consistently sided with their interests over those of workers whenever they\nconflict. The IGDA is one of these organizations, of course (see our review of\nthe IGDA in the previous issue!), but there are other examples too. A similar\nrole is played in Québec by &quot;La Guilde&quot;, and in France by the &quot;Syndicat National\ndu Jeu Vidéo&quot; (SNJV, not to be confused with the STJV, which is the actual\nFrench game workers&#39; union).</p>\n<h4 id=\"scab-labour\">Scab Labour</h4>\n<div class=\"md-img right off-6\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/plague-rat.png\"\n  alt=\"Plague Rat of Doom\"\n/>\n</div>\n\n<p>One of the dirtiest tricks a boss can employ, <strong>&quot;scabs&quot; are people who, as\nworkers themselves and thus potential members of a union, receive special\npreferential treatment over others in exchange for turning against their fellow\nworkers</strong>. Scabs are often brought in temporarily from the outside in an\nemergency as a way to replace workers who are trying to unionize. Bosses will\nsometimes even make a point of offering scabs all the demands that the\norganizing workers originally put forward, while continuing to refuse them to\nthe latter — just as a way of demoralizing you by making the point that your\ndemands can in fact easily be met, but that it&#39;s really about punishing you &quot;on\nprinciple&quot; for standing up for your rights.</p>\n<p>During the SAG-AFTRA voice actors&#39; strike in 2017, scab voice actor labour was\nnotably used — and <a href=\"https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/yw55zx/crappy-voice-acting-undercuts-an-otherwise-strong-life-is-strange-prequel\">roundly\ncriticized</a>\n— in the <em>Life Is Strange</em> prequel <em>Before the Storm</em>.</p>\n<p>In order to work towards the long-term goal of a unionized game industry, it\nwill be important to create a culture where taking a scab contract is treated as\nthe despicable, selfish act that it is — and one that harms the scabs themselves\nin the longer term.</p>\n","prevPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/unionfaqs-below-the-grassroot","name":"Below the (Grass)root"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/unionfaqs-below-the-grassroot","name":"La syndicalisation, à la base"}},"nextPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/unionfaqs-get-indie","name":"Get Indie?"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/unionfaqs-get-indie","name":"Devenir Indie ?"}},"description":"As union talk continues to spread throughout the game industry, bosses who feel threatened are turning to an arsenal of tactics to break up organizing and discourage and demoralize workers.
