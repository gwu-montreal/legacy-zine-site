A union is a group\nof workers organizing together, regardless of whether or not they&#39;re a\nregistered legal entity. If that&#39;s not always obvious today, it&#39;s because many\ngovernments impose daunting-sounding legal requirements for forming a union; for\nexample, in Australia a trade union needs at least 1000 members to be officially\nrecognized. These requirements are the result of decades of lobbying by business\nowners. It&#39;s meant to weaken the power of labour and undermine our ability to\nbuild collective power.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we don&#39;t need to follow these rules to start organizing! And you\ndefinitely don&#39;t need your whole industry or your whole workplace on board to\nstart changing things for the better. You can start by talking to your coworkers\n— off the clock, in private — about things you wish were better. Existing labour\norganizations can help you figure out how to rally together and get organized\nfrom the ground up. And if you&#39;re working in a big multinational, international\ngroups like the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) might be your best help at\nbuilding workplace solidarity across offices and borders: one of the ways unions\nhave been hobbled by law is by limiting their legal existence to a single\ncountry.</p>\n<div class=\"md-img off-1\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/faqs/pikmin.png\"\n/></div>\n","prevPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/unionfaqs-what-are-strikes","name":"What Are Strikes?"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/unionfaqs-what-are-strikes","name":"Que sont les grèves ?"}},"nextPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/boss-tactics","name":"Boss Fight Tips & Tricks"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/boss-tactics","name":"Boss Fight, les soluces"}}},"path":"en/unionfaqs-below-the-grassroot"}
