But despite outcries, precious little has changed in that time — in fact,\nthings seem to be getting worse. A year ago, we took matters into our own hands\nand started <a href=\"https://gameworkersunite.org\"><strong>Game Workers Unite</strong></a> (GWU) to\ncollectively fight for better conditions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"are-you-tired-of-crunch-\">Are you tired of crunch?</h2>\n<h2 id=\"are-you-struggling-to-pay-bills-do-you-lack-basic-benefits-like-health-care-insurance-or-paid-sick-and-parental-leave-\">Are you struggling to pay bills?

Do you suspect you&#39;re paid less than your coworkers because of your race or gender?</h2>\n<p>As game workers, we recognize that <strong>these widespread issues will persist as\nlong as we have to depend on management to address them</strong>. It is only through\nworkers of the game industry organizing <strong>on our own terms</strong> and <strong>in order to\ndefend our collective interest as workers</strong> that any progress will be possible.</p>\n<p>GWU is comprised exclusively of workers — no bosses!\n— and has chapters across the globe. We are building a\nmovement of pro-union solidarity and helping game\nworkers organize for better conditions at their workplace\nwherever they may be.</p>\n<p>The game industry is making record profits, yet very\nlittle of that is flowing into the hands of the people who\n<em>actually create the games</em>. Together, we have the power\nto change this.</p>\n"}},"path":"en"}
