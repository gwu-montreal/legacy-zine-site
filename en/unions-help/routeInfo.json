Here are some things\nunions have fought for and won in the past:</p>\n<p>Safety regulations • Health care insurance • Ending unpaid overtime •\nUnemployment insurance • Protection from mass layoffs\nand unfair firings • Anti-harassment policies • Closing the wage gap • Paid sick\nleave • Paid parental leave • Annual leave • Pensions • Week-ends • Meal breaks •\nAbolishing child labour</p>\n<p>In the sections that follow we&#39;ll break down some of the specific ways that\nunions can help workers in the game industry.</p>\n<h3 id=\"layoffs\">Layoffs</h3>\n<p>Most game work is contract or &quot;project&quot;-based, meaning that many game workers\nmay find themselves out of a job when projects (even very successful ones) are\nlaunched. This is already an unhealthy way to work, but on top of that sometimes\nworkers are laid off without any warning whatsoever.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;ve never participated in or been represented by a union, you might be\nwondering how it can help with something like mass layoffs; cuts are cuts,\nright? Well — not quite. One of the most important things a union can achieve\nfor a workplace or industry is a <strong>collective agreement</strong> (sometimes called a\ncollective bargaining agreement, CBA, or collective labour agreement; the term\nvaries by country). A collective agreement is not the only way of\norganizing or making demands — but it&#39;s a common and battle-tested one, and most\ncollective agreements include some form of protection from layoffs by employers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some CBAs don&#39;t allow layoffs <strong>even when the employer claims that it doesn&#39;t\nhave enough money to pay everyone on payroll</strong>… Similarly, many CBAs bar\nemployers from laying off union workers and subcontracting out their jobs.</p>\n<p>Many CBAs require employers to &quot;recall&quot; or rehire laid-off workers once the\nneed for the layoff subsides (for example, when work picks up again).\n(<a href=\"https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/labor-employment-law/employment-contracts/can-your-union-save-you-from-a-layoff.html\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an industry that often experiences cycles of hirings and layoffs as projects\nramp up to full production, go gold, get cancelled, or change in scope, it&#39;s\npretty obvious that even a weaker &quot;right to recall&quot; could still help buy workers\nextra stability and peace of mind.</p>\n<p>Employers often treat the skilled labour force of game workers in a given region\nas a &quot;talent pool&quot; that they can sponge people from when they need them, and\nwring people back into when they&#39;re no longer needed. But we know that\n<strong>precarity doesn&#39;t have to be a condition of working in the industry</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crunch\">Crunch</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In those days, Miyamoto would come to us at 11 PM, after he finished all of\nhis board-member work, and say, <strong>&quot;It&#39;s Mario time.&quot;</strong> At that point, we&#39;d\nstart a planning meeting that would run until 2 AM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"md-attribution\">\n&#x2014;\n<a href=\"https://kotaku.com/at-nintendo-working-all-night-is-mario-time-1794042341\">\nFormer Nintendo planner Motoi Okamoto on the development of Mario 64 DS\n</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Last October, with the release of Red Dead Redemption 2 imminent, Rockstar Games\nco-founder and boss Dan Houser proudly declared to New York Magazine that\nworkers <strong>were regularly putting in 100-hour work weeks getting the game ready\nto ship</strong>. Hang on — if you sleep around 8 hours a night there&#39;s only 112 hours\nin a week! Factor in transit (presuming people weren&#39;t sleeping under their\ndesks, which is not a given), time to eat, etc., and that works out to Rockstar\nlabourers spending almost every waking moment at their job.</p>\n<div class=\"md-img right off-2\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/pizza.svg\"\n  alt=\"Pizza slice\"\n/>\n</div>\n\n<p>Houser later retracted the statement, saying only the writing team was working\nthose hours, and only during a period of a few weeks. But that only prompted\nbacklash from current and former workers: some called out the obvious falsehood\nof the retraction and told stories of the immense pressure placed on them (one\nformer worker <a href=\"https://archive.fo/2M7CG\">noted</a> &quot;during the <em>GTA IV</em> era, it was\nlike working with a gun to your head, 7 days a week&quot;) while others were just\nunhappy to have their backbreaking labour downplayed and denied by a studio\nhead.</p>\n<p>Houser and others seem to think that crunch is a sign of dedication and passion\nand speaks to the quality of their game. <strong>But crunch is abusive</strong>. It can go on\nfor months — even years — and it has very real long-term mental and physical\nhealth impacts for developers. In 2015, <em>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em> creative\ndirector Clint Hocking recalled the effects prolonged crunch had on his health\nduring development of that game a decade prior:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[My friend] had spent a week living in my house. I had curtailed my work week\ndown from 70-80 hours to a normal 40 in order to spend time with him. We had\neaten great meals, gone to great bars, seen movies, played games, and talked\nabout our careers and the industry and our pasts and our futures, and all of\nit was simply fucking gone. I could not remember any of it.</p>\n<p>To be clear — I do not mean I didn&#39;t remember what we did or what we talked\nabout. I mean that I literally had no memory of the events. To me it was like\nit never happened. It was like he never visited. There was just an empty space\nin my brain that had been overwritten by the stress and anxiety of Splinter\nCell. <strong>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory gave me brain damage.</strong>\n(<a href=\"https://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2015/03/ten-years-down.html\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe Hocking got off easy. In 2016, a game developer at South Korean company\nNetmarble was\n<a href=\"https://massivelyop.com/2017/08/04/crunch-mode-caused-a-young-netmarble-game-developers-death-korean-government-says/\">acknowledged</a>\nto have &quot;died from a work-related cause&quot; after putting in months of intense\novertime.</p>\n<p>Many in the game industry try to paint crunch as unavoidable, but we believe it\nis ultimately a story of poor planning and unreachable deadlines — and more\nimportantly, of <strong>putting profits above the human beings whose labour makes\ngames</strong>. Concretely, unions can discourage crunch by <strong>ensuring that employees\nare paid for overtime</strong>, by <strong>increasing overtime rates</strong>, and by <strong>putting a\nhard limit on how many hours of overtime can be required in a given day or\nweek</strong>. This helps those already in the industry, but it also makes it more\nlikely that employers will hire more people instead of cheating prospective\nworkers out of a job by forcing too much work on existing employees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When in Bioware they said they had a three-month crunch, we laughed. During\nthe Witcher 3, a lot of people crunched for over a year — some of them for\nthree years.</p>\n<p>Witcher 3 development kept getting worse by the month. The morale got very low\nand everyone ended up complaining during crunch supper. Some of us were still\nlooking forward to being moved to Cyberpunk and having a fresh start with a\n&quot;new&quot; project. When we finally started switching to Cyberpunk… things got even\nwilder, even more chaotic. At that time, almost everybody in my team wanted to\nleave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"md-attribution\">\n   &#x2014;\n   <a href=\"https://www.gamezone.com/news/cd-projekt-red-developers-speak-up-on-the-realities-of-working-on-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-3461430/\">\n    CD Projekt Red developer on conditions at the studio\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"harassment\">Harassment</h3>\n<p>Harassment has been a well-known problem in the game industry for years now, but\nso far <strong>bosses have done little to actually address the issue</strong> apart from\nreleasing boilerplate statements about how the company &quot;condemns harassment.&quot;\nWhen harassment happens inside the workplace, workers often have nowhere to\nturn. HR departments are supposed to be the first port of call, but too often\nthey&#39;re more concerned with protecting the company&#39;s public image than they are\nwith protecting the employees.</p>\n<div class=\"md-img right off-9\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/mug.svg\"\n  alt=\"Mug\"\n/>\n</div>\n\n<p>Unions can help by providing workers with a place they can go to make sure their\nconcerns are heard, and unlike HR, they are directly answerable to the workers\nthey represent. While an individual worker could be ignored or even fired for\ntalking about their experiences with harassment (especially if the harasser is\nin a position of power within the company), they are much more likely to be\ntaken seriously when they have the <strong>backing of other employees</strong>. Unions can\nalso push for systemic changes, such as the introduction of anti-harassment\npolicies or training programs, that help prevent harassment from happening in\nthe first place.</p>\n<p>Harassment is more likely to happen in situations where employers or managers\nhave unilateral power to make or break an employee&#39;s career, and therefore\n<strong>anything that tips the balance of power in favour of employees also helps\nreduce harassment</strong>. Since harassment is often tied to discrimination and a lack\nof diversity in the workplace, measures that increase diversity such as fairer\nhiring practices, wage equity, or more comprehensive health benefits, can also\nbe a way to curb harassment.</p>\n<p>Marginalized workers, who are more likely to be the targets of harassment, are\n<strong>already organizing</strong> in many workplaces through whisper networks and informal\nsupport groups. These efforts often form the foundations for wider organizing\ncampaigns, and help build solidarity, trust, and mutual respect between workers.\nWhile businesses push workers to compete with one another for jobs or raises,\ncreating a hostile and toxic work culture, the process of unionizing encourages\nworkers to come together to solve their problems collectively. <strong>Solidarity is\nkey to building a successful union campaign</strong>, and once workers realize this,\nthey are more likely to change views and behaviours that ultimately just serve\nto divide and disempower us.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creative-control\">Creative Control</h3>\n<p>You might believe your employers&#39; motivation is to create great games, and in\nsome cases that may be true. But at the end of the day they&#39;re here to make\nmoney, and that has a direct influence on creative decisions. Executives don&#39;t\nnecessarily care that the development team is aiming to make, say, a great\nsingle-player game, but they <em>do</em> care about how Battle Royale games are\noutselling everything else right now and how microtransactions are a major\ndriver of revenue for large publishers. So the order comes from above to add\nthose things to the project, even if they are creatively incompatible.</p>\n<p>The pursuit of profit is what drives bosses to prioritize one project over\nanother, to think about ad placement, to change design based on market research,\nand make other kinds of creative compromises. This is also what leads companies\nto cancel more experimental projects in favour of the &quot;safe bet,&quot; or force\nworkers to meet unrealistic deadlines in order to release before the holiday\nseason.</p>\n<p>If you work in the industry, <strong>how often have you had to implement or cut\nfeatures following a decision by an executive</strong>, which ended up being\ndetrimental to the quality of the game? <strong>Don&#39;t you wish you&#39;d had the power to\nnegotiate in that kind of situation?</strong> Don&#39;t you wish you&#39;d at least been asked\nfor your input, instead of having to work silently in a direction only to have\nto start again from scratch a month later because higher-ups decided a new trend\nneeded to be worked into the project somehow?</p>\n<p>Workers in the game industry are passionate about what they do — that&#39;s why\ncompanies get away with exploiting them! — so it is particularly hurtful when\nthey&#39;re forced to create things that they don&#39;t believe in. Whether workers\nultimately agree with management&#39;s decisions or not, at least <strong>in a unionized\nworkplace, their opinion gets to be voiced and heard</strong>.</p>\n<p>A strong unionized workforce or a worker co-op doesn&#39;t just help improve\nconditions in the workplace! It also allows the people who <em>actually make the\ngames</em> to exercise more creative control and put their efforts towards something\nthey believe in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crediting-issues\">Crediting Issues</h3>\n<p>In games, credits are one of the most important ways your efforts as a worker\nget noticed. If you&#39;re new to the games industry, you might believe that getting\ncredited for your work on a game is a straightforward process. But that&#39;s not\nalways the case. Rockstar, for example, is known for holding credits over\nworkers&#39; heads as a reward for finishing work on a game. As journalist Richard\nMoss <a href=\"https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/329003/How_bad_crediting_hurts_the_game_industry_and_muddles_history.php\">wrote last\nyear</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For studios, crediting can be a tool for leverage … [Rockstar] has long\nmaintained a policy of not crediting people who worked on a game unless they\nwere present when it shipped, to encourage the team &quot;to get to the finish\nline.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This form of &quot;encouragement&quot; is not just manipulative, it hurts workers&#39; ability\nto find future employment.</p>\n<p>Workers in other industries (such as film) have <a href=\"http://www.bccfu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2015-2018-BCCFU-MASTER-AGREEMENT-Appendix-C.pdf\">fought for and\nwon</a>\nthe right to proper crediting through unions. Unions can do the same for the\ngames industry.</p>\n<h3 id=\"better-pay\">Better Pay</h3>\n<p>Here&#39;s an easy one: <strong>unionized workers have higher wages on average than\nworkers who are not unionized</strong> — often between <strong>15 to 25%</strong> more. With the\nleverage of an organized workforce, collective bargaining is a very effective\nway to make sure you&#39;re paid what you&#39;re worth. But <strong>unions also benefit\nworkers who are not unionized</strong> by raising the bar for everyone. For example, a\nhigh school graduate whose workplace is <em>not</em> unionized but who works in an\nindustry that&#39;s 25% unionized overall <strong>can still <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/briefingpapers_bp143/\">expect to be paid\nmore</a></strong> than similar\nworkers in less unionized industries.</p>\n<p><strong>Unions can also help reduce inequality</strong>. While all workers benefit from\nhaving unions, those who benefit the most are typically the people who are the\n<strong>most disempowered or in the most precarious positions</strong>. On top of improving\ngeneral working conditions for these folks, it also turns out solidarity is a\ngreat way to <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0730888401028004005?journalCode=woxb&amp;\">cut down the gendered pay\ngap</a>.</p>\n","prevPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/unionfaqs-whats-a-game-worker","name":"What's a Game Worker?"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/unionfaqs-whats-a-game-worker","name":"Qu’est-ce qu’un·e “travailleu·se·r du jeu vidéo”?"}},"nextPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/unionfaqs-history-of-unrest","name":"A History of Unrest"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/unionfaqs-history-of-unrest","name":"Un passif d'agitation"}},"description":"A union is an organization of workers dedicated to improving wages, hours, and working conditions within their workplace or industry through collective bargaining.
