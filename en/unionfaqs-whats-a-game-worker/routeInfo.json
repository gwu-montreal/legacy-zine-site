Why\nnot just &quot;game dev&quot;? Isn&#39;t that simpler?</p>\n<p>When we talk about game workers, we&#39;re referring to <strong>anyone involved with the\nproduction of a game</strong>. Programmers, artists, designers, musicians? Yep. Voice\nand mocap actors, audio engineers? Definitely. Community managers? Of course.\nBut we&#39;re also talking about workers whom players may not instantly associate\nwith production. What about factory workers who manufacture the consoles that\ngames are played on? And workers mining the\n<a href=\"https://videogamesoftheoppressed.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/conflict-minerals-and-games/\">coltan</a>\nused in those consoles? How about the people working to prepare food at the\ncafeteria on the company campus? Even if it may be less obvious, these workers\nare all <strong>essential to the production of games</strong>. They&#39;re game workers too.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re in the industry but currently unemployed, <strong>you&#39;re also a game\nworker</strong>. The same goes for students and interns. In an industry where so much\nlabour is erased or goes unrecognized, it&#39;s important that we stick together and\nresist bosses&#39; efforts to divide and conquer.</p>\n<div class=\"md-img off-8\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/faqs/lemmings.png\"\n/></div>\n","prevPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/intro","name":"From the Desk of the Editors"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/intro","name":"Un mot de la r√©daction"}},"nextPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/unions-help","name":"What Can Unions Do to Help?"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/unions-help","name":"Comment les syndicats peuvent-ils aider ?"}}},"path":"en/unionfaqs-whats-a-game-worker"}
