It sounds absurd when you think about it: many\nworkers take a great deal of pride and personal satisfaction from making games\nthat players love to play, and without workers there would be no games for\nplayers to enjoy in the first place. Unfortunately, <strong>many players don&#39;t know\nthe conditions under which games are made</strong> (in large part because bosses\nprevent workers from talking about it publicly!). They are also encouraged to\nsee themselves as having a special relationship with a brand, a company, or a\nproduct, rather than with the real people making the games they play. This\ndynamic encourages consumers to blame workers when things go wrong, and benefits\nowners. Throwing workers under the bus directs negative attention away from the\nbosses, even when they&#39;re the ones responsible for making decisions that hurt\nconsumers. It can also serve as an intimidation tactic that can be used to\ndiscipline workers.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re unfortunately all too familiar with the way a small but extremely vocal\nminority of consumers take entitlement to the next level in their relationship\nto developers. As more game workers speak up about working conditions in the\nindustry, <strong>we&#39;ve also seen hate-driven harassment campaigns appearing in\nresponse</strong>. Often this harassment specifically targets marginalized workers who\nare simply trying to participate in the creative direction of the games they\nbuild and speak to their own struggles, backgrounds, and experiences. Individual\nworkers become singled out and targeted by an online mob of entitled consumers\nwho don&#39;t want to see the game industry become more welcoming to new voices and\nwho scapegoat them for everything they believe is wrong with games.</p>\n<p>Sadly, they often succeed in goading bosses into punishing or even firing these\nworkers: two well-known examples are <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/9/17549492/arenanet-jessica-price-guild-wars-2-writer-fired\">last year&#39;s firing of Jessica Price and\nPeter Fries from\nArenaNet</a>\nand <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-employee-terminated-after-smear-campaign-over-1768100368\">the dismissal of Alison Rapp from Nintendo in\n2016</a>.\nLook a little closer and you&#39;ll discover these aren&#39;t isolated cases: in private\nconversation, in whisper networks, <strong>incidents like these are all too common</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"md-img right off-8\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/poison.svg\"\n  alt=\"Poison bottle\"\n/>\n</div>\n\n<p>Giving in to demands from angry, reactionary gamers is a convenient excuse for\nbosses to get rid of &quot;troublesome&quot; workers — like, say, someone speaking out\nabout sexism and racism in their workplace. <strong>Many game industry bosses see\ntheir priorities as being more in line with the harassers than with the people\nwho work for them.</strong> (THQ Nordic recently reminded us of this by choosing to do\na marketing Q&amp;A on 8chan, a website known for harboring Nazis, enabling the\nspread of child porn, and playing a leading role in massive hate campaigns\ntargeted against marginalized game workers.)</p>\n<p>In these situations, management will often pretend to have the best interests of\nworkers in mind even as they systematically yield to the slightest strain and\nvalidate gamer entitlement. <strong>This can lead to bosses implementing new ways of\ncontrolling, suppressing, and disciplining their workers, all under the guise of\n&quot;protecting them&quot; from such harassment.</strong> (Protecting from what? Getting fired\nfor standing up to harassment? Some protection racket that is!) After ArenaNet\npresident Mike O&#39;Brien fired developers Price and Fries at the demand of an\nonline mob — for committing the egregious offence of pushing back against the\nmisogyny women game designers face in the industry — many employers jumped on\nthe occasion to introduce new social media policies restricting what their\nemployees are allowed to express online outside of working hours. These policies\neffectively make workers responsible for being a 24/7 brand ambassador on top of\ntheir regular job — and for no additional compensation, to boot. (What a\nbargain!)</p>\n<p>In her article from October on the topic, &quot;<em>Worse than Scabs: Gamer Rage as\nAnti-Union Violence</em>&quot;, <a href=\"https://rhizome.org/editorial/2018/oct/30/worse-than-scabs-gamer-rager-as-anti-worker-violence/\">Lana Polansky\nwrites</a>\n:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;<strong>As long as gamers direct their grievances at individual workers</strong>,\nvideogame companies understand that they can use that dynamic <strong>to shield\nthemselves from community criticism</strong> while <strong>using it as leverage</strong> in\ninternal conflicts with employees. This has, for a long time, represented a\nwin-win for companies, ensuring not just the PR victory with their fans, but\nalso a deeply suppressed and compliant workforce, and an opaque shroud over\nthe industry&#39;s internal workings. That shroud, however, seems to be starting\nto clear.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"md-img left off-8\">\n<img\n  src=\"/images/gamecube.svg\"\n  alt=\"Gamecube\"\n/>\n</div>\n\n<p>This tactic was deployed in 2016 when studio owners at Activision, EA, Disney,\nWarner Bros, Take-Two, and others <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/28/13458724/voice-actors-strike-video-game-website-attacks\">launched a\nwebsite</a>\nand video <em>explicitly targeting a gamer audience</em> that demonized the SAG-AFTRA\nvoice actors&#39; union. At the time, union members were demanding, among other\nthings, better safety standards for voice strain and risks associated with stunt\ncoordination (for motion capture), an improved structure for bonus payments,\nbetter transparency, and employment mobility. <strong>In a blatant effort to direct\nfan rage at the workers</strong>, bosses argued that these demands would somehow lead\nto worse games for consumers.</p>\n<p>Executives ultimately answer to shareholders and investors, and thus to the\nprofit motive. They&#39;ll give in to the cry of a vocal, angry minority of\nperceived fans <em>even if the consequence in the long-term is a worse game</em>. We\ncan&#39;t rely on them to have our backs on this front: <strong>we need to have each\nother&#39;s</strong>. The best way to resist harassment — and the summary, mob-driven\nfirings that so often seem to follow — is by organizing. And if gamers really\nwant to see better games, <strong>they should focus their attention on the bosses and\nthe conditions employees are forced to work under</strong>, not on individual\nvulnerable employees that are easily scapegoated. But for this to mean anything,\n<strong>the conversation also needs to go beyond a simplistic call to &quot;vote with your\ndollars&quot;</strong> and to buy more from the &quot;good companies&quot; and less from the bad ones.\nPlayer support for unionization will go much farther towards crafting a better\nindustry.</p>\n","prevPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/unionfaqs-profit-sharing","name":"Is Profit-Sharing What We Want?"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/unionfaqs-profit-sharing","name":"Vers un partage du profit ?"}},"nextPages":{"en":{"route":"/en/unionfaqs-what-are-strikes","name":"What Are Strikes?"},"fr":{"route":"/fr/unionfaqs-what-are-strikes","name":"Que sont les grèves ?"}},"description":"Sam [Dan's brother and Rockstar president] and I talk about this a lot, and it's that games are still magical.
