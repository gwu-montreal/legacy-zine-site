Here are six simple steps to get you on your way to forming a union! <strong>Make sure
to keep discussions about the possibility of unionizing away from the ears of
employers, even if you think they&#39;re sympathetic to your cause.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Reach out to existing unions</strong> and organizations in your area for help,
advice, and solidarity. <a href="https://www.gameworkersunite.org">Game Workers Unite
chapters</a>, related trade and industrial
unions, and existing game worker unions internationally are all great
resources for learning how to organize your own workplace, and establishing
relationships now can strengthen both parties&#39; actions in the future. <strong>If
possible, talk to experienced organizers or attend a training session on
workplace organizing.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Talk to your coworkers</strong> one-on-one about their problems in the workplace,
away from the supervision of management. Ask questions, and let them tell you
the things that they want to fix; listen carefully, and don&#39;t assume you know
what their problems are. Be supportive and understanding, and help them
realize they&#39;re not alone in these issues. <strong>Don&#39;t start talking about unions
yet!</strong> Start by identifying problems to solve.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Help them identify collective solutions</strong> to the problems they&#39;ve shared.
Just talking about issues isn&#39;t enough; stopping there can build frustration
and anger without being constructive with those feelings. Your goal is to
guide your co-workers towards seeing collective action as a solution to their
problems, by asking questions and listening to their answers. Open-ended
questions like &quot;Who else feels this way?&quot; and &quot;What would happen if…&quot; are
useful. <strong>Always be honest!</strong> Don&#39;t oversell what&#39;s possible, and don&#39;t
minimize the potential dangers.</p>
</li>
</ol>

alt="Snake, you can't just start talking about unionizing in the open. If Big Boss finds out, you're going to be in trouble. You have to be sneaky about it!"
/>
</div>

<ol start="4">
<li><p><strong>Organize a first action</strong> to solve a simple, achievable problem. You don&#39;t
need the whole office on board! Start with 10% of your coworkers, and target
something concrete and achievable: demanding free coffee, or complaining to
the boss as a group. By winning these fights, you and your coworkers will see
the power of collective action, gain courage and experience, and inspire
others to join in the next action. <strong>Before you take that first action,
though…</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prepare your coworkers for the bosses&#39; reaction</strong> when they find out you&#39;re
organizing. Bosses have a lot of tactics to break up organizing workers, and
they can be very effective and intimidating to the unprepared, but they&#39;re
also very predictable. Learn these tactics yourself, and share them with your
coworkers. These plays are much less effective when people know they&#39;re
coming, and you&#39;ve already had a chance to counter their anti-union lines.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Push your coworkers to become organizers themselves</strong>. You can&#39;t do
everything yourself, so help your coworkers become more involved by giving
them tasks and following up. A task can be anything from taking notes at a
meeting, to designing and printing flyers, to bringing in new members
themselves. Don&#39;t forget to set deadlines and follow up on these tasks; this
is real and important work, and doing it is empowering. Eventually, your
coworkers will be suggesting their own tasks and managing themselves!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Only go public when you&#39;re confident you have the backing of the majority of
your workforce</strong> and you have a concrete plan that everyone has agreed upon.
People are routinely fired for trying to unionize, so make sure to protect your
privacy, and the privacy of your fellow workers. In most countries a worker&#39;s
right to unionize is protected under law, so make sure to inform yourself on
what your rights are (local unions can help with this).</p>
