<p>As game workers, we recognize that <strong>these widespread issues will persist as
long as we have to depend on management to address them</strong>. It is only through
workers of the game industry organizing <strong>on our own terms</strong> and <strong>in order to
defend our collective interest as workers</strong> that any progress will be possible.</p>
<p>GWU is comprised exclusively of workers — no bosses!
— and has chapters across the globe. We are building a
movement of pro-union solidarity and helping game
workers organize for better conditions at their workplace
wherever they may be.</p>
<p>The game industry is making record profits, yet very
little of that is flowing into the hands of the people who
<em>actually create the games</em>. Together, we have the power
to change this.</p>
