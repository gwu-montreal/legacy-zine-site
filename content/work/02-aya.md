A work-in-progress VJ/DJ tool and visual creative environment, initially
prototyped between April and July of 2017. Oriented towards immediate
gratification and low barriers to entry – there’s a web-based version to allow
users to quickly jump in and start experimenting, and audio and video can be
streamed in from YouTube or a microphone, etc. (it even works on phones!)

Browser tech is pretty amazing to me. It’s easy to forget that what we use to
read Facebook or check email can also serve as a synthesizer, a 3D renderer, a
MIDI interface – and offers lots of other rich affordances besides. I’ve been
thinking a lot about how so many folks are carrying this kit of creative tools
in their pocket, and how it would just take a bit of plumbing to make those
tools much more accessible and pliable. Since there are many future directions
this project could take me, it’s at times been helpful for me to think of it in
this way while prototyping – as just a bit of plumbing to make low-hanging
affordances a little bit easier to reach.

The project is currently on hiatus – I’m trying to find a way to keep working on
it sustainably.
