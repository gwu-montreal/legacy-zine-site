We will not defend an industry characterized by workplace discrimination, low
wages, crunch, and short careers ending in burnout. **Whether or not we are
currently employed, we are game workers**, and we reject the unsustainable
conditions we have endured for far too long. **The game industry is our industry,
and together we have the power to improve it.**
