Labour conditions and mass layoffs in the game industry have made the news for
years. But despite outcries, precious little has changed in that time â€” in fact,
things seem to be getting worse. A year ago, we took matters into our own hands
and started **Game Workers Unite** (GWU) to collectively fight for better
conditions.

## Are you tired of crunch?

## Are you struggling to pay bills? Do you lack basic benefits like health care insurance or paid sick and parental leave?

## Are you made to endure harassment at work?

## Do you suspect you're paid less than your coworkers because of your race or gender?


As game workers, we recognize that **these widespread issues will persist as
long as we have to depend on management to address them**. It is only through
workers of the game industry organizing **on our own terms** and **in order to
defend our collective interest as workers** that any progress will be possible.
